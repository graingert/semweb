	abstract = {{OpenPrivacy.org} is building an Internet platform to take us into the next age - the age of secure personalized information. Basic to this goal is a platform that will provide people with complete control over their personal information and aid them in protecting their privacy while simultaneously enabling more efficient data mining by marketers and the access to highly desirable market segments by advertisers.

    {OpenPrivacy} creates a secure marketplace for anonymous demographic and profile information, and a distributed, attack-resistant, reputation-based rating system that can be used for everything from item selection and ordering to search result filtering. Further, this system is completely open, allowing multiple communication mechanisms, languages and ontological meanings to coexist. This platform thrives on diversity.

    To accomplish our goals, we introduce three new concepts: Opinions, Bias and Reputations. These are all first class, signed objects that are created at will under a multitude of pseudonymous entities maintained by the user. A fourth concept, that of a personal profile, is created virtually from a collection of the first three objects in such a way that only the owner of the information can validate the connections between them. However, if granted access, others (marketers, advertisers, online community builders and the like) may mine the profile for potentially profitable or otherwise valuable correlations while the owner of the profile maintains her anonymity.},
