% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of

% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors

\section{Introduction}
Traditionally on the Semantic Web (SW) anyone, or more specifically any agent, can make assertions about any URI.  Clearly in some cases this is not a desirable feature\footnote{A self-declared unreliable information source: \url{http://data.totl.net/steve.rdf}}.


What is trust

Trust as a service
trust composition and trust propagation
types of trust
"proposed approach differentiates and explicitly
defines the relationship between trust concepts and ... trust algorithms"
Bootstrapped Trust, GlobalTrust, PersonalisedTrust, DirectTrust, PropagtedTrust, CompositeTrust
\cite{sherchan_trust_2010}


What is an agent? Simple distributed objects, complex autonomous entities.
\cite{kalfoglou_emergent_2004}

The heart of SW
Independent agents and providers of knowledge.
Clearly also applies to services.

The choice of trust strategy depends on the cost of failure (could lead to a catastrophe) and risks.  Risk/Cost/Benifit analysis.

``The main point of a trust strategy is to provide a way to operate under uncertainty'': Operational costs, Oppohttps://www.bitcoinstore.com/information-technology/computer-systems/mobile-computers.htmlrtunity cost, Deficiency cost, Service charges (academic ghetto).

Five basic strategies: Optimism, Pessimism, Centralized, Investigation, Transitivity.
\cite{ohara_trust_2004}

About users
Confidence of the author is important
Social network analysis
``TRELLIS is an interactive tool that helps users annotate the
rationale for their decisions, hypotheses, and opinions as they analyze information from various sources''\cite{gil_trusting_2002}

Hyperlinked pages could be used as a trust network, SW is better because the SW allows concept relationships to be marked up, no need to use heuristics
In social web, Erdos or Bacon number can be used to determine potential trust between friends.
foaf:knows should not be used to give trust, as that's semantically incorrect
defines a trust ontology with 9 levels of trust.

N-Ary relationship pattern to add ``TrustsRe'' links, can trust a person ``trustsPerson'' on a particular subject ``trustsOnSubject''
The calculated trust $t$ from node $i$ to node $n$ is given by the following function:
\begin{equation}
t_{is}=\frac{\sum_{j=0}^{n}{\begin{cases}
(t_{js}*t_{ij}) & \text{ if } t_{ij} \geq t_{js} \\ 
(t_{ij}^2) & \text{ if } x= t_{ij} < t_{js}
\end{cases}}}{\sum_{j=0}^{n}{t_{ij}}}
\end{equation}
where $i$ has $n$ neighbors with paths to $s$.

centralized web service to maintain trust data
A centralized repository that uses transitive algorithms.
TrustMail queries web service 
\cite{golbeck_trust_2003}

A concrete ontology for trust, with the same intention as discussed in the paper.
\cite{jennifer_golbeck_trust_2013}


``The degree to which an agent considers an assertion to be true for a given context. While the term ``trust'' is often used to denote a very high degree of confidence, there is an associated risk of the assertions being wrong.''

Public Key Infrastructure PKI using certificate hierarchy.
Needs a chain of signing to the root CA.

Web of Trust popularized by PGP, similar to Bacon numbers from \cite{golbeck_trust_2003}

``The pervasive use of digest values to identify the statements in the Semantic Web will engender a preponderance of evidence for trust without cryptography.''

Declares that highly inter-related values are trust-able, does not note however that it is vulnerable to Sybil\cite{douceur_sybil_2002}
\cite{reagle_key_2002}

Web of trust ontology can be used to serialize the PGP WOT
\cite{_web_2004}

\section{Existing Trust Systems}
GPG WOT
Bitcoin is syntacticly similar to trust based systems such as the PGP WOT, the subtle difference 

\section{Adding Semantic Web}
Semantic Web Trust Ontologies/ Network types
\subsection{A Comparison of Vocabularies}
WOT/RDF
Key Free Trust

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
We worked hard, but discovered very little.
