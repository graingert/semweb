\section{Introduction}
The OED defines `trust' as ``confidence in or reliance on some quality or attribute of a person or thing, or the truth of a statement''.  However, within the context of technology literature this word has taken on a domain specific definition.  O'Hara  et al~\cite{ohara_trust_2004} describe trust as ``a method of dealing  with uncertainty'' specifically with regards to the actions an agent may take. Similarly, though more generally,  Golbeck et al~\cite{golbeck_trust_2003} describes trust  in terms of users and the statements they make.

Trust is an integral issue within Semantic Web as anyone, or more specifically any agent, can make assertions about any object with a valid URI and each of these assertions are considered with equivalent certainty.  While this makes merging datasets trivial within the Semantic Web\cite{golbeck_trust_2003}, this is not a desirable mode of operation for collaboration, automatic discovery or composition of agents and services\footnote{A self-declared unreliable information source: \url{http://data.totl.net/steve.rdf}}.


TODO: THUS.... general point you are making in the paper.

\section{Trust Systems without the Semantic Web}
The PGP Web of Trust (WOT)\cite{_how_pgp_1999} splits it's trust model into two distinct attributes, `validity' and `trust'.   Validity is confidence that a particular public key belongs to its purported owner, other users can vouch for the validity of this public key however this requires trusting said people's endorsement - this is where the second metric is required.  Trust is the confidence one has in the judgement of the users who are asserting the validity of the particular public key.  A user's determination of the validity of a particular key can come from a direct determination of validity or via the transitive assertions of trusted users i.e. user A trusts user B who trusts user C then user A transitively trusts user C.

The PGP WOT is implemented using a graph of weighted edges between public keys, where an edge from $k_A$ to $k_B$ is defined as a message referencing $k_B$ with the cryptographic signature generated by the private key of $k_A$. If $k_A$ trusts $k_B$ and $k_B$ trusts $k_B$ then $k_A$ can trust $k_C$.

While this trust operates through public key cryptography, the semantics of the network are extremely important.  For example, Bitcoin is syntactically similar to the PGP WOT - a graph of signatures with signed messages representing weighted edges, however the semantics of the system is significantly different\cite{bitcoin}.  Within the Bitcoin protocol, each node of the graph (a public key) is limited to having the same total weight of outgoing edges as incoming edges so that the system can represent value transfer instead of trust this is in comparison to PGP WOT in which users are free to make whatever statement, regarding trust connections, they wish.

\section{Adding Semantic Web}
As ``the heart of the Semantic Web'' O'Hara et al~\cite{ohara_trust_2004} define five basic trust derivation strategies: Optimism, Pessimism, Centralized, Investigation, Transitivity.

\paragraph{Optimism} assumes that agents are trustworthy ``unless proven otherwise''
\paragraph{Pessimism} is the opposite of Optimism, assuming that agents are untrustworthy.
\paragraph{Centralized} trust systems use a single institution to define the trust of other agents
\paragraph{Investigation} trust is allocated after the investigation of other agents. Attributes of those agents that reduce uncertainty are explicitly investigated.
\paragraph{Transitivity} requires a network of agents describing mutual trust. Similar to social network trust methods used with the PGP WOT and The Trust Project~\cite{_how_pgp_1999,golbeck_trust_2003}.

These strategies are chosen based on various cost definitions ``The main point of a trust strategy is to provide a way to operate under uncertainty'': Operational costs, Opportunity cost, Deficiency cost, Service charges. The choice of trust strategy depends on the cost of failure (could lead to a catastrophe) and risks.  Risk/Cost/Benifit analysis.

Independent agents and providers of knowledge. These same trust trust algorithms can be described semantically for service oriented systems using the ``Trust Service Ontology'' described by Sherchan et al~\cite{sherchan_trust_2010}. The Trust Service Ontology allows trust composition and trust propagation and semantically describes different types of trust: ``proposed approach differentiates and explicitly
defines the relationship between trust concepts and ... trust algorithms''

The classes of trust defined are: Bootstrapped Trust, GlobalTrust, PersonalisedTrust, DirectTrust, PropagtedTrust and CompositeTrust.

\subsection{A Comparison of Vocabularies}
WOT/RDF
Key Free Trust

``For example, just because a person can confirm the source of documents does not license them to trust the content of those documents. Indeed, confirmation that some documents are the work of a noted forger gives strong support to distrusting their content. This project addresses ``trust'' as credibility or reliability in a much more human''

Confidence in the source of a statement does not necessarily 


What is an agent? Simple distributed objects, complex autonomous entities.
\cite{kalfoglou_emergent_2004}

About users
Confidence of the author is important
Social network analysis
``TRELLIS is an interactive tool that helps users annotate the
rationale for their decisions, hypotheses, and opinions as they analyze information from various sources''\cite{gil_trusting_2002}

Hyperlinked pages could be used as a trust network, SW is better because the SW allows concept relationships to be marked up, no need to use heuristics
In social web, Erdos or Bacon number can be used to determine potential trust between friends.
foaf:knows should not be used to give trust, as that's semantically incorrect
defines a trust ontology with 9 levels of trust.

N-Ary relationship pattern to add ``TrustsRe'' links, can trust a person ``trustsPerson'' on a particular subject ``trustsOnSubject''
The calculated trust $t$ from node $i$ to node $n$ is given by the following function:
\begin{equation}
t_{is}=\frac{\sum_{j=0}^{n}{\begin{cases}
(t_{js}*t_{ij}) & \text{ if } t_{ij} \geq t_{js} \\ 
(t_{ij}^2) & \text{ if } x= t_{ij} < t_{js}
\end{cases}}}{\sum_{j=0}^{n}{t_{ij}}}
\end{equation}
where $i$ has $n$ neighbors with paths to $s$.

centralized web service to maintain trust data

A concrete ontology for trust, with the same intention as discussed in the paper.
\cite{jennifer_golbeck_trust_2013}


``The degree to which an agent considers an assertion to be true for a given context. While the term ``trust'' is often used to denote a very high degree of confidence, there is an associated risk of the assertions being wrong.''

Public Key Infrastructure PKI using certificate hierarchy.
Needs a chain of signing to the root CA.

Web of Trust popularized by PGP, similar to Bacon numbers from \cite{golbeck_trust_2003}

``The pervasive use of digest values to identify the statements in the Semantic Web will engender a preponderance of evidence for trust without cryptography.''

Declares that highly inter-related values are trust-able, does not note however that it is vulnerable to Sybil\cite{douceur_sybil_2002}
